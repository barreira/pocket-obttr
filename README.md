## Pocket Order By "Time to Read"

Simple command line app that retrieves a [Pocket](https://www.getpocket.com/) user's saved items and orders them by "time to read", exporting the results to a csv file. Items with no "time to read" field (e.g. saved twitter links) will be ignored.

I have a lot of stuff saved in Pocket. I like reading the shortest articles first if I don't have the time to spare. Pocket only sorts by oldest/newest. Pocket doesn't have sort by "time to read". I built this.

_Note: It is required that you authenticate and give the app read access so as to be able to get the articles you have saved in Pocket._
