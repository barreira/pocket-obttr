# pocket-obttr
Simple command line app that retrieves a user's [Pocket](https://www.getpocket.com/) saved items and orders them by time to read, exporting the results to a csv file. Items with no "time to read" field (e.g. saved twitter links) will be ignored.

It is required that you authenticate and give the app read access so as to be able to get the articles you have saved in Pocket.
